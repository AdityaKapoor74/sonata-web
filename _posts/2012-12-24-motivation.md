Social navigation datasets are necessary to assess social nav-igation algorithms and train machine learning algorithms. Most of thecurrently available datasets target pedestriansâ€™ movements as a patternto be replicated by robots. It can be argued that one of the main rea-sons for this to happen is that compiling datasets where real robots aremanually controlled, as they would be expected to behave when moving,is  a  very  resource-intensive  task.  Another  aspect  that  is  often  missingin datasets is symbolic information that could be relevant, such as hu-man activities, relationships or interactions. Unfortunately, the availabledatasets  targeting  robots  and  supporting  symbolic  information  are  re-stricted to static scenes. This paper argues that simulation can be usedto gather social navigation data in an effective and cost-efficient way andpresents a toolkit for this purpose. A use case studying the application ofgraph neural networks to create learned control policies using supervisedlearning is presented as an example of how it can be used.
